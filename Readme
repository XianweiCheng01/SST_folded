There are four folders, graph_500, sstcore, sst-elements and sst-macro

change the name of folder .git_ori under sst-macro to .git

sstcore, sst-elements and sst-macro can be build and installed by refering following links
https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-core

https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-macro/blob/master/manual-sstmacro-11.1.pdf

Add the /directory/of/sst/macro/bin/ to your PATH. after sstcore, sst-elements and sst-macro have been installed.
Then the graph_500 can be compiled.

Running simulation:

Running simulation with the sd1_many.py in sst-macro/skeletons/hpcg-3.0, it build a system with merlin routers.


step1: generate graph data
  set the generate_data in main.c (line 118) to true
  modifing line 130 in sd1_many.py to decide the graph size based on your requirement
  running the simulation with 1 node (modify sd1_many.py line 138 to (aprun -n 1 -N 1))
  cmd: sst sd1_many.py
step2: running simulation with generated graph data

Using merlin router
  set the generate_data to false
  modifing line 130 in sd1_many.py to select the graph data will be used
  modifing other part of sd1_many.py to configure the system
  running the simulation
  cmd: sst sd1_many.py

Using logp switch
  set the generate_data to false
  modifing line 7 in parameters.ini to select the graph data will be used
  modifing parameters.ini and daebug.ini to configure the system
  running the simulation
  cmd: pysstmac -f parameters.ini --exe=./graph500_reference_bfs_sssp
