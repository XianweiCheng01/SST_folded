This is a simple project used to test compatibility of the sst-macro compiler wrappers with autotools environments. 

Bootstrap the project:
# ./bootstrap

Configure/run the test executable with real mpi compilers (no simulation):
# ./run_config.sh
# make
# ./run_test.sh

Configure/run the test using sst-macro compilers and simulator:
# ./run_config_macro.sh
# make
# ./run_test_macro.sh

Note: Make sure the desired compilers or compiler wrappers are found in your path.
